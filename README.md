# Wireless Communications: BER & OFDM Simulations

This project includes MATLAB Live Script simulations analyzing BER and capacity in various wireless channel models, both narrowband and frequency-selective. Topics include:

- BPSK, QPSK, and PPM modulation
- Fading channels (coherent and non-coherent)
- Time & spatial diversity (MRC, Alamouti)
- OFDM system design (CP, FFT/IFFT)
- Power allocation via Waterfilling
- Equalization (ZF, MMSE)
- Clipping effects in OFDM
